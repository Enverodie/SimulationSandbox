Objectives:

* Add clickable buttons to control active state
* Display hotkeys to control state
* Cells that were created in one stage and deleted in the same stage should not leave a body
* Add support for different lifeform tick speed
* Add conflict
* Add a timer that keeps track of WHEN to calculate the next stage for any given lifeform
* Only render objects inside the viewport
* Further improve dead cell rendering efficiency for large inputs when moving/resizing canvas
* Fix bug where cursor doesn't update unless moved

Considerations:
* MOVE ALL THE as (ACTIVE STATE) VARIABLES INTO simControls BECAUSE THEY BASICALLY DO THE SAME THING
* Add a class "lifeforms" that stores information about each created lifeform (perhaps including all their maps)
* Add a counter in a corner of the screen that shows what generation the simulation is on
* Improve rendering strategy for delete cell overlay
