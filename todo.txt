Objectives:

* Add a GUI
* Add support for multiple lifeforms
* Add support for different lifeform tick speed
* Add conflict
* Add a timer that keeps track of WHEN to calculate the next stage for any given lifeform
* Only render objects inside the viewport
* Cells that were created in one stage and deleted in the same stage should not leave a body

Considerations:
* Add a class "lifeforms" that stores information about each created lifeform (perhaps including all their maps)
